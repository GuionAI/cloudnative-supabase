# NOTE: This is a placeholder. In a real deployment:
# 1. Run generate-secrets.sh from ../templates/
# 2. Generate JWT tokens (see script output for instructions)
# 3. Encrypt with SOPS (in your deployment repo)
# 4. Reference the encrypted files here

# Example (after creating encrypted secrets):
# resources:
#   - cnpg-secrets.enc.yaml      # CNPG managed role passwords
#   - supabase-secrets.enc.yaml  # JWT secret + analytics API key
