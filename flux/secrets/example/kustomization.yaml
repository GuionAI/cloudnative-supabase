# NOTE: This is a placeholder. In a real deployment:
# 1. Copy templates from ../templates/
# 2. Generate secrets with generate-secrets.sh
# 3. Encrypt with SOPS (in your deployment repo)
# 4. Reference the encrypted files here

# Example (after creating encrypted secrets):
# resources:
#   - cnpg-secrets.enc.yaml    # CNPG managed role passwords
#   - supabase-jwt.enc.yaml    # JWT secret (anonKey, serviceKey, secret)
